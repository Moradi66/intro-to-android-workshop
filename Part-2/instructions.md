## Part two

Let’s Start Building the App Layout
------

1. Open the layout file


2. Change the layout to a Relative layout


3. Amend the TextView


4. Add another TextView

5. Import the Image

6. Add the Image View

7. Add Buttons


If you run the app now, you’ll see all your changes on your emulator/phone.

Nothing happens when you press the buttons!

Also, those buttons are grey and dreary, let’s spice things up a bit in [Part three](../Part-3/instructions.md).
